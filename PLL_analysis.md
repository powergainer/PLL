# PLL analysis

A PLL as a frequency synthesizer is a system designed to generate an output signal that replicates the phase noise characteristics of an input reference clock.

Input reference clock - crystal oscillator
---
The input reference clock is usually an external, off-chip Crystal oscillator. This crystal oscillator is very accurate and very low phase noise.

A [crystal oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_oscillator) can generate a square wave at an input frequency `Fref` and let's call its phase `phi_ref`.
